# fork-status — show this fork's delta vs upstream and flag features that
# upstream may have adopted (so they can be dropped from the stack).
#
# Usage: scripts/fork-status.sh   (run from anywhere inside the repo)
#
# Reading the output:
#  - "Fork commits": the whole stack this fork carries. Keep it short.
#  - "Adoption hints": fork-added symbols that now also exist in upstream
#    files — a strong sign upstream built (or merged) the same feature.
#    Verify with `git log upstream/main -S<symbol> --oneline | head` and, if
#    genuinely adopted, drop the fork commit:
#      git rebase -i upstream/main   # delete the obsolete commit line
#      git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
#  - Commits that upstream cherry-picked verbatim disappear from the stack
#    automatically on the next `hermes update` rebase (git skips
#    patch-identical commits) — those need no action at all.
